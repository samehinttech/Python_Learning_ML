"""
This module demonstrates the use of 2D lists (lists of lists) in Python.
Note that modifying a 2D list is similar to modifying a regular list.

# Example 1: Creating a 2D list (list of lists) and accessing its elements.
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]

# matrix[row index][column index]

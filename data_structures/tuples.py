"""
Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable (cannot be modified).
They are defined using parentheses () instead of square brackets [].
In other words, once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

Definition: Tuple are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data.
Note that single element tuples need a trailing comma, e.g., (1,). Without the comma, it is just an integer in parentheses.

# Tuples are immutable, so the following line would raise an error if uncommented

# However, you can concatenate tuples to create a new one

# Note: Tuples have only two built-in methods: count() and index()

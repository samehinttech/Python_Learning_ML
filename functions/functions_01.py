"""
This module demonstrates the basics of defining and using functions in Python.
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
They help in organizing code, improving readability, and reducing redundancy.
In this example, we define two simple functions that print messages to the console.
Each function is called to show how they work.
The functions do not take any parameters and do not return any values.

# Defining a simple function with no parameters and no return value
def start_function_1():
    print("\nFunction 1 started...")
    print("Function 1 in progress...")
    print("Function 1 completed.")
    print("Function 1 ended.")


# Defining another function
def start_function_2():
    print("\nFunction 2 started...")
    print("Function 2 in progress...")
    print("Function 2 completed.")
    print("Function 2 ended.")


# Calling the functions
start_function_1()
start_function_2()

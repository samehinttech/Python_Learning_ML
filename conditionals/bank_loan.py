"""
This is a simple program to practice conditionals in Python.
The program calculates the down payment for a house based on the buyer's credit status.
I will also use more than just if statements to practice logical operators.
Story:
price of a house is $1,000,000
if a buyer has good credit:
    they need to put down 20%
if a buyer has bad credit:
    they need to put down 30%
Print the down payment and other loan details.

# Determine down payment percentage based on buyer's credit
if buyers_credit == 0:
    print("Loan Denied: You have no savings for the down payment.")
else:

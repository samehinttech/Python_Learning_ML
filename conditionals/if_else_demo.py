This script demonstrates conditional statements in Python using if, elif, and else.
I will also use more than just if statements to practice logical operators.

# Define a variable

# Conditional statements, Here you can change the values of good_weather, is_raining, and temperature to see different outputs.

# Another example with nested conditions
"""
Here the first condition checks if the weather is good, If true, it checks the temperature to give, if it is true it will print 
a message for warm weather, if false it will print a message for chilly weather.
If the first condition is false, it checks if it is raining and prints a message accordingly.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints a message about unpredictable weather.

# Example with multiple conditions
"""
This example uses logical operators to combine multiple conditions.
It checks if the weather is good and the temperature is above 15 degrees for outdoor activities.
if the good_ weather is false it checks if it is raining or the temperature is below 5 degrees to suggest staying indoors.
If none of these conditions are met, it suggests that the weather is moderate.
IMPORTANT: AND operator returns true if both conditions are true, OR operator returns true if at least one condition is true.

    print("Not the best weather for going out.")

"""
This module demonstrates the use of logical operators in conditional statements.
It includes examples of 'and', 'or', and 'not' operators.

- 'and' operator: True if both conditions are true.
- 'or' operator: True if at least one condition is true.
- 'not' operator: Inverts the truth value of a condition.

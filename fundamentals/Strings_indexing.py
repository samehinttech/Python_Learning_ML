"""
This script demonstrates string indexing in Python.
It covers positive and negative indexing, as well as slicing.
It also includes examples of string immutability and how to work around it.

# Define a sample string
sample_string = "Hello, World!"
print(f"Sample String: {sample_string}")

# Positive Indexing
first_char = sample_string[0]  # First character

fifth_char = sample_string[4]  # Fifth character
print(f"Positive Indexing: First character: '{first_char}', Fifth character: '{fifth_char}'")

# Negative Indexing
last_char = sample_string[-1]  # Last character
second_last_char = sample_string[-2]  # Second last character
print(f"Negative Indexing: Last character: '{last_char}', Second last character: '{second_last_char}'")

# Slicing
substring = sample_string[0:5]  # Characters from index 0 to 4
print(f"Slicing: Substring from index 0 to 4: '{substring}'")

# Slicing with a step value
step_slice = sample_string[0:12:2]  # Every second character from index 0 to 11 as the end index is exclusive
print(f"Slicing with step: Every second character from index 0 to 11: '{step_slice}'")


# More indexing examples
from_start_to_end = sample_string[:]
print(f"Slicing from start to end: '{from_start_to_end}'")


# String Immutability
# Note: Strings in Python are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created.
# To modify a string, you need to create a new string.
modified_string = sample_string[:7] + "Universe!"  # Creating a new string to replace "World" with "Universe", it keeps all characters from index 0 to 6 and adds "Universe!"
print(f"String Immutability: Modified string: '{modified_string}'")

# Reversing a String using slicing
# [start:stop:step] with a step of -1 reverses the string
# start: 0 (beginning of the string)
# stop: None (goes until the end of the string)
# step: if step is positive(slicing moves forward(left to right)), if step is negative(slicing moves backward(right to left))
# step: -1 (moves backwards through the string), if step is negative, start should be greater than stop to get a non-empty result

reversed_string = sample_string[::-1]  # Reverses the string
print(f"Reversed String: '{reversed_string}'")

# Length of the string
# Note: The len() function returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and punctuation.
string_length = len(sample_string)
print(f"Length of the string: {string_length}")

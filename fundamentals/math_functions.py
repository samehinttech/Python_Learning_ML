# First, we need to import the math module to access the mathematical functions.
# Math is an object that we can access its operations and properties using dot notation.

# Absolute Value

# Exponentiation

# Square Root
number_for_sqrt = 16

# Logarithm

# Additional Mathematical Functions
# Ceiling: Rounds a number up to the nearest integer

# Factorial: Computes the factorial of a number
# Factorial is only defined for non-negative integers
# Rule: n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1, and 0! = 1 by definition, where n is a non-negative integer.

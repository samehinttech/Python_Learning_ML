"""
Class constructor is a function called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class.
In Python, the constructor is defined using the `__init__` method. The `__init__` method is called automatically when a new instance of the class is created.
IMPORTANT REMARKS:
1. The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes. It is called a constructor and is used to initialize the attributes of the class.
2. The `self`
    parameter in the `__init__` method refers to the instance of the class itself. It is used to access variables and methods associated with the current object.
3. You can define parameters in the `__init__` method to pass values when creating an instance of the class.
4. The `__init__` method does not return any value. It is used only for initialization.
5. You can create multiple instances (objects) of a class, each with its own set of attributes initialized through the constructor.
6. If you do not define an `__init__` method, Python will provide a default constructor that does nothing.
7. You can also define default values for parameters in the `__init__` method.
8. The `__init__` method can be overloaded by defining multiple constructors with different parameters using default values or variable-length arguments.

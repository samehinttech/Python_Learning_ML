"""
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the child or subclass) to inherit
attributes and methods from another class (called the parent or superclass).
This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
IMPORTANT REMARKS:
1. Inheritance is defined by specifying the parent class in parentheses after the child class name.
2. The child class inherits all attributes and methods from the parent class, allowing it to use them as if they were defined in the child class itself.
3. The child class can override methods from the parent class to provide a specific implementation.
4. The child class can also add new attributes and methods that are not present in the parent class.
5. The `super()` function is used to call methods from the parent class, allowing access to the parent class's methods and attributes.
# from more than one parent class.
6. The `isinstance()` function can be used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or a subclass thereof.
7. The `issubclass()` function can be used to check if a class is a subclass of another class.

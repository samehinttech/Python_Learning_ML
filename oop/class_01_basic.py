"""
Classes are the backbone of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, just like in many other programming languages.
A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes),
and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

IMPORTANT REMARKS:
1. Classes are defined using the `class` keyword. Naming conventions suggest using CamelCase for class names.
2. The `__init__` method is a special method called a constructor, which is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created.
3. The `self` parameter in method definitions refers to the instance of the class itself. It is used to access variables and methods associated with the current object.
4. Methods are functions defined within a class that operates on instances of the class.
5. Attributes are variables that hold data associated with a class and its instances.
6. You can create multiple instances (objects) of a class, each with its own set of attributes.
7. Classes can also have class variables (shared across all instances) and instance variables (unique to each instance).

- We can add new attributes to the instance
- Note that these attributes are not defined in the class itself, but we can add them dynamically to the instance
- Note that this is the simple way to add attributes to an instance, but it's better to define them in the __init__ method
